# Plan {A}

> Alright — over the past 25 years, I’ve proven to myself (quite convincingly) that I’m terrible at planning, so I’ll just skip that part ..!

- ### Philosophy
  
  - #### [`@minejs`](https://github.com/minejs-org)

    > Everything has a shared logic and can work independently.
    >
    > I write the code once, and I use it wherever I want.
  
  - #### [`@cruxjs`](https://github.com/cruxjs-org)

    > I dislike most existing frameworks for reasons I can’t fully explain,
    >
    > so I decided to build a new one — a smart wrapper around all the components in [@minejs](https://github.com/minejs-org).
  
  - #### [`@cruxjs-kit`](https://github.com/cruxjs-kit)

    > After more than 15 years of building websites, I can confidently say I’ve built the same structure for thousands of clients.
    >
    > Every time, I ended up rewriting the same things over and over again
    >
    > (things like notifications, profiles, dashboards… the stuff that exists in almost every app).
  
    > So, following the same idea as [@minejs](https://github.com/minejs-org), I’m writing these pieces once here,
    >
    > to reuse them later across all applications built with [@cruxjs](https://github.com/cruxjs-org).
 
  - #### [`@cruxjs-plugins`](https://github.com/cruxjs-plugins)

    > This one is a bit different.
    
    > These are not just pre-made components like @cruxjs-kit.
    > 
    > They are full, dynamic plugins with their own complete logic and lifecycle.
    
    > For example, I plan to have plugins like: `@cruxjs-plugins/auth`, `@cruxjs-plugins/oauth`, and so on.
    >
    > Plugins can use and build on top of @cruxjs-kit when needed.
