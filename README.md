- ## The Problem

  > 25 years of building and burning.
  >
  > Not from failure. From perfection's curse.

  > Every system reaches 60% and becomes chaos. Every architecture collapses under its own complexity. Every project gets deleted before dawn.
  >
  > MMORPG at 11 years old. Operating systems. Programming languages. Frameworks. Libraries. Platforms.
  >
  > **All deleted.**

  > Not because they failed, but because chaos is unbearable to a perfectionist's mind.
  >
  > But time ran out. The body is failing. The mind refuses to stop.
  >
  > **One last architecture. One that survives.**

  <br>

- ## The Solution

  > Not another framework. **The end of frameworks.**
  >
  > Stop rewriting. Stop rebuilding. Stop repeating.

  **Build once. Use forever.**
  ```
  @minejs    → Utilities with zero dependencies
  @minejsx   → JSX freed from React
  @cruxjs    → Framework that trusts you
  @mineui    → CSS that knows context
  @cruxui    → Patterns proven 25 years
  @cruxplug  → Modules that extend, not explode
  ```

  ```
  nezam      → Space for impossible dreams
  ```

  - ### Philosophy

    - #### [@minejs](https://github.com/minejs-org)
      > Pure logic. No frameworks. No lock-in.
      > Works anywhere. Forever.

    - #### [@minejsx](https://github.com/minejsx-org)
      > JSX is syntax, not React's property.
      > Fast runtime. Zero overhead.

    - #### [@mineui](https://github.com/mineui-org)
      > Context-aware CSS.
      > Same component, different pages, automatic styling.

    - #### [@cruxjs](https://github.com/cruxjs-org)
      > Orchestrates without dictating.
      > No magic. No "framework way."

    - #### [@cruxkit](https://github.com/cruxkit-org)
      > Every UI pattern you've built 1000 times.
      > **This is the last time.**

    - #### [@cruxplug](https://github.com/cruxplug-org)
      > Backend modules with their own worlds.
      > Plug in, don't bolt on.

    - #### [nezam.dev](https://nezam.dev)
      > Workspace for dreams too big for tools.
      > `User → Workspace → Modules → ∞`

- ## The Truth

  > I've deleted more code than most developers will ever write.
  >
  > Not from incompetence. From standards no human can sustain.
  >
  > OCPD doesn't let you ship imperfect work. It makes you a prisoner of your own mind.

  > But this time, the architecture defeats the curse.
  >
  > **Modular by design. Perfect in isolation. Chaos-proof by nature.**
  >
  > Each package stands alone. Each module is complete. The system never becomes overwhelming.
  >
  > **This is how you build forever.**
