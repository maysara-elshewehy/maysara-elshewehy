  - ### Philosophy

    - #### [@minejs](https://github.com/minejs-org)
      > Pure logic. No frameworks. No lock-in.
      > Works anywhere. Forever.

    - #### [@minejsx](https://github.com/minejsx-org)
      > JSX is syntax, not React's property.
      > Fast runtime. Zero overhead.

    - #### [@mineui](https://github.com/mineui-org)
      > Context-aware CSS.
      > Same component, different pages, automatic styling.

    - #### [@cruxjs](https://github.com/cruxjs-org)
      > Orchestrates without dictating.
      > No magic. No "framework way."

    - #### [@cruxkit](https://github.com/cruxkit-org)
      > Every UI pattern you've built 1000 times.
      > **This is the last time.**

    - #### [@cruxplug](https://github.com/cruxplug-org)
      > Backend modules with their own worlds.
      > Plug in, don't bolt on.

    - #### [nezam.dev](https://nezam.dev)
      > Workspace for dreams too big for tools.
      > `User → Workspace → Modules → ∞`

    - #### Phase 2.5: Reset & Rebuild
      > started: 09-01-2026

      > _The first attempt succeeded, but **perfection demands more**._
      > 
      > _Before moving forward, a **critical** reset is necessary._
    
      - #### Current State
  
        > @cruxkit and @mineui are 90% AI-generated. The output quality is unacceptable.
        > 
        > Manual reconstruction is required, executed in stages to maintain sustainability.
 
      - #### New Approach
  
        > Building a living documentation system through incremental examples:
        > 
        > - Start with `cruxjs_app_hello_world` - a single homepage, fully explained
        > - Next repo adds error handling, references the previous, explains the delta
        > - Each repository builds on the last, one concept at a time

      - #### The Why

        > Knowledge retention through repetition. My mind needs time to internalize this volume of information.
        > 
        > This isn't just a framework - it's a complete UI paradigm shift. Not HTML. Not CSS. Not standard JSX.
        > A new system that generates the necessary backend automatically, eliminating the noise.
        > 
        > Building manually, repeatedly, cements understanding. Essential for teaching others later.

      - #### Philosophy
  
        > Ignore the current CSS quality. Focus on architecture.
        > 
        > Each piece must be built by hand, understood completely, then documented.
        > 
        > **This is how mastery happens.**

- ## The Truth

  > I've deleted more code than most developers will ever write.
  >
  > Not from incompetence. From standards no human can sustain.
  >
  > OCPD doesn't let you ship imperfect work. It makes you a prisoner of your own mind.

  > But this time, the architecture defeats the curse.
  >
  > **Modular by design. Perfect in isolation. Chaos-proof by nature.**
  >
  > Each package stands alone. Each module is complete. The system never becomes overwhelming.
  >
  > **This is how you build forever.**
