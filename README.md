- ## The Problem

  > 25 years of building and burning.
  >
  > Not from failure. From perfection's curse.

  > Every system reaches 60% and becomes chaos. Every architecture collapses under its own complexity. Every project gets deleted before dawn.
  >
  > MMORPG at 11 years old. Operating systems. Programming languages. Frameworks. Libraries. Platforms.
  >
  > **All deleted.**

  > Not because they failed, but because chaos is unbearable to a perfectionist's mind.
  >
  > But time ran out. The body is failing. The mind refuses to stop.
  >
  > **One last architecture. One that survives.**

  ---

- ## The Solution

  > Not another framework. **The end of frameworks.**
  >
  > Stop rewriting the same patterns. Stop rebuilding the same components. Stop fighting the same battles.
  >
  > **Package them once. Use them forever.**

  ```
  @minejs  → Utilities that stand alone
  @minejsx → JSX freed from React
  @cruxjs  → Framework without constraints
  @mineui  → CSS that knows its context
  @cruxui  → Components that just work
  @cruxup  → Backend that extends, not explodes
  nezam    → Space for impossible dreams
  ```

  - ## Philosophy

  - ### [@minejs](https://github.com/minejs-org)

    > Core utilities that stand alone yet connect seamlessly.

    > No dependencies on frameworks. No lock-in to ecosystems. No vendor worship.
    >
    > Just pure logic that works anywhere, browser, server, edge, terminal.
    >
    > Build once. Use everywhere. Forever.

    ---

  - ### [@minejsx](https://github.com/minejsx-org)

    > JSX without the framework overhead.

    > JSX was never React's property. It's syntax. Universal syntax.
    >
    > Lightweight runtime that renders fast, reacts instantly, weighs nothing.
    >
    > Use it anywhere. Build UIs everywhere. No framework prison.

    ---

  - ### [@cruxjs](https://github.com/cruxjs-org)

    > A framework that trusts your instincts.

    > Built to orchestrate @minejs without imposing unnecessary constraints.
    >
    > No magic. No hidden behavior. No "framework way."
    >
    > You write the logic. It connects the pieces. That's it.

    ---

  - ### [@mineui](https://github.com/mineui-org)

    > CSS that knows where it lives.

    > The same button looks different in auth vs dashboard,automatically.
    >
    > Context-aware styling. Zero specificity wars. No more copy-pasting stylesheets.
    >
    > **Separation of logic and presentation. Finally done right.**

    ---

  - ### [@cruxui](https://github.com/cruxui-org)

    > The patterns that work, packaged once.

    > Every project repeats the same UI challenges:
    >
    > Dropdown. Popup. Form validation. Toast notifications. Data tables. Auth flows.
    >
    > **You've built them 1000 times. I've built them 1000 times.**

    > **This is the last time.**
    >
    > Patterns proven over 25 years. Battle-tested. Optimized. Documented. Ready.
    >
    > Drop into any @cruxjs app. Styled by @mineui. Just works.

    ---

  - ### [@cruxup](https://github.com/cruxup-org)

    > Backend features that plug in, not bolt on.

    > Living, breathing services with their own worlds.
    >
    > Auth. Logs. Workspaces. Storage. Each module is self-contained, fully functional, infinitely extensible.
    >
    > Add features to your system without rewriting everything.

    ---

  - ### [nezam.dev](https://nezam.dev)

    > The space where dreams stop being impossible.

    > Not project management. Not collaboration tools. Not another SaaS template.
    >
    > **A workspace for anyone with a dream too big for existing tools.**

    ```
    User → Workspace → Modules → Infinite possibilities
    ```

    > Your friend needs a furniture store? Module.
    >
    > You need project management? Module.
    >
    > Someone needs a blog platform? Module.

    > **Give people the space. They'll build their world.**

- ## The Truth

  > I've deleted more code than most developers will ever write.
  >
  > Not from incompetence. From standards no human can sustain.
  >
  > OCPD doesn't let you ship imperfect work. It makes you a prisoner of your own mind.

  > But this time, the architecture defeats the curse.
  >
  > **Modular by design. Perfect in isolation. Chaos-proof by nature.**
  >
  > Each package stands alone. Each module is complete. The system never becomes overwhelming.
  >
  > **This is how you build forever.**
